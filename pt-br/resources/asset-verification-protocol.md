# Waves Asset Verification Protocol

## Motivation

Waves Platform allows to create and transfer any asset. The only threshold for the creator is to pay a fee (currently 1 waves). This lowers the threshold for entering the platform but opens up a lot of opportunities to send spam at a relatively low price. Also scam assets could be used for fraudulent purposes, for example by duplicating, fully or in part, the name of an existing cryptocurrency or a well-known company with the aim of misleading users.

We want to protect users from suspecious assets and ensure verified assets are used. It could be possible with some kind of listings generated by token holders with voting system or by a trusted organizations in compliance with established rules, access to which is public.

Here we present a standard that allows the exchange of information about tokens between data providers and applications using the Waves blockchain.

Any company or individual provider can provide information about tokens, verify/certify projects that have issued a token in the Waves blockchain. Any application using the Waves blockchain can use the information provided by the providers.

An example of such provider is [bettertokens](http://bettertokens.org/) - Tokenization Standards Association, a non-profit organization, the main function of them is development of due diligence standards for companies engaged in the tokenization of assets and initial coin offerings (ICO)/ token generation events (TGE). 

## Specification

Our protocol is supposed to serve as an interaction between providers and the blockchain. A provider can be both a centralized organization with a developed methodology and a decentralized service for ranking tokens by voting or multisignature signing. 

Each provider has its own Waves address. It can be created specially for the purpose of asset verification or used for other goals as well.

Before starting to supply information about tokens, providers must fill information about itself as one data entry of DataTransaction. Then, for each token, the provider fills another data entry in the same DataTransaction, with status and detailed information. DataTransaction is sent to smart account address and could be read then as account state. Example of such transaction in JSON format:

```
{
  "sender": "3FjTpAg1VbmxSH39YWnfFukAUhxMqmKqTEZ", 
  "data": [
   {
      "key": "data_provider_name", // provider initialization key
      "type": "string", 
      "value": "Example Asset Verification Provider", // company name 
   }, {
      "key": "data_provider_link", 
      "type": "string", 
      "value": "http://example.com", // provider’s site 
   }, {
      "key": "data_provider_email", 
      "type": "string", 
      "value": "example@gmail.com", // contact email 
   }, {
      "key": "data_provider_logo_meta", 
      "type": "string", 
      "value": "data:image/png;base64", // information about a logo type (svg, png, jpg … ) 
   }, {
      "key": "data_provider_logo", 
      "type": "binary", 
      "value": "base64:__base64_image_code__", // provider's logo 
   },  {
      "key": "data_provider_lang_list", 
      "type": "string",
      "value": "en" // a list of available languages for provider's description
    }, {
      "key": "data_provider_description_<en>", // provider initialization key
      "type": "string", 
      "value": "Verification provider", // provider info 
    }
  ]
}
```

Description of every asset consist of several data entries, first one is status_id describing measure of trust/threat:

Table 1. Tokens statuses

| Status | Description | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2 | Verified |  Verified and trusted assets, issuers passed KYC, official gateway tokens and so on |
| 1 | Described | Tokens with clear description which are not phishing or scam |
| 0 | Unknown | Default status. No need to add it to providers list unless provider wants to remove an asset from the list |
| -1 | Suspicious | Asset looks suspicious or used for spam |
| -2 | Dangerous | Dangerous scam and phishing assets |
