# DEX API

Our nodes contain an order matcher which is used to power our decentralized exchange — enabling token trades that don’t require tokens to be transferred from your blockchain account to a separate exchange. All operations within the DEX are secure and validated by blockchain nodes. Since the DEX is open source and a part of every node, each user can run their own instance of the DEX.

[_**The matcher exposes its own REST API**_](/waves-api-and-sdk/dex-api/matcher.md) for accessing the order book and submitting orders. This allows users to implement any kind of trading UI or trading bots.
