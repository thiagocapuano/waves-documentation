# Waves Payments API

If you want to make someone pay with WAVES or any other Waves tokens, you can use our Payments API.

## Process

1. You need to set up a button on your site which triggers the creation of an URL and a redirect to it.
2. A user decides to buy something and the user presses that button.
3. After that, the user is redirected to the Waves Client with a payment parameters window.
4. The user modifies those parameters if possible and submits the form.
5. If everything's okay, The user is redirected back to referer.
6. Referer is provided with transaction ID which can be checked if it's in the blockchain.

If the user interrupts the process, he stays on the Waves Client page.

## Details

[**Here**](https://demo.wavesplatform.com/payment-api) you can find the demo project which shows how to use Payment API for donations. The Payment API allows creating a special link for avoiding users' seed input on 3-party sites.
