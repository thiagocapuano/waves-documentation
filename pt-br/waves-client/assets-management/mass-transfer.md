# How to distribute a Token using Mass Transfer

You can make mass transfers right from your Waves wallet.
With this feature, you can distribute your Token, Waves or any other Waves based tokens on your balance directly to multiple (up-to 100) Waves addresses with several most natural actions.

Let's make distribution for Waves tokens, although this method also works for any other tokens of your balance. Before you start, please make sure that you have enough Waves for the transaction fee.

Open up your Waves wallet.  
At the top left corner click on the **Send** button.

* **Note**:You can use up-to 100 addresses per one request.
* Please use the following syntax: **Address,Amount** For example: **3P9KR33QyXwfTXv8kKtNGZYtgKk3RXSUk36**,**0.12345**
* **Description**: Optional. You can write a message for the recipient in the Attachment field.
* **Total Amount**: This field calculates the total number of sending tokens.
* **Fee**: The transaction fee depended on the number of recipients and calculated using the following formula: **0.001 + 0.0005 * Number of recipients**.

After you have filled the form, click on the **Continue** button.
The following pop-up will appear.

To complete the operation, double-check the entered data and if everything is good click on the **Confirm** or click on the **Go Back** to repeat the process.
