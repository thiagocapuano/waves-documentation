If you have done all of the above, you are forwarded to the user interface.

If you find an address that does not belong to you and your balance is empty, it means that you have incorrectly restored access. To gain access, you need to repeat the restoring procedure.

**Note**: The seed phrase always contains 15 words with spaces between each word, except the beginning of the first word and the end of the last word. It is not possible to recover your password. However, you can restore your wallet only from the seed phrase, and choose a new password.

If you lose both your password and your seed, there is no way to recover your money. This is why we ask you to save your seed phrase on paper.

**Wavesplatform does not have access to users accounts and seed phrases**.

## How to pairing accounts between devices

Also, you can synchronize your accounts between [Mobile apps](/waves-client/mobile-apps.md) and desktop or online accounts. So, to sync your account from the desktop or online app, just open Waves app > **Settings** > **General** > **Export account**.
