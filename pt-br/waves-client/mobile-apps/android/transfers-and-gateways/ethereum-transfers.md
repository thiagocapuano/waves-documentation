## Introduction

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Ethereum on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Ethereum sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Ethereum token \(wETH\) on the Waves blockchain. Every single Ethereum token is backed 1:1 with the real Ethereum.

>If you will send less than 0.005 ETH, you will lose that money.

**Please do not deposit ETH from smart contracts! Do not deposit ERC20 tokens! Only Ethereum is allowed**

## How to use sponsored fee

Waves users can also use a sponsored fee to pay for outgoing transfers. Check your portfolio, if you see there a token with **%** icon. So it means you can change the default Waves fee to another sponsored token.

So how to do it? Just create an outgoing transfer described above and click on the **WAVES** under **Continue** button.
Choose an available sponsored token and click on the **Continue** button.
