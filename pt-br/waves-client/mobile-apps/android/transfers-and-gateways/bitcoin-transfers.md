## Introduction

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Bitcoin on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Bitcoins are sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Bitcoin token \(wBTC\) on the Waves blockchain. Every single Bitcoin token is backed 1:1 with the real Bitcoin.
