# How to Create an Account

You can use either [**Online Client**](https://dex.wavesplatform.com), or standalone version for [**Windows**](https://wavesplatform.com/files/WavesClient-win.zip), [**Mac**](https://wavesplatform.com/files/WavesClient-mac.dmg) or [**Linux**](https://wavesplatform.com/files/WavesClient-linux.deb). All versions support automatic update!

Choose and open up your Waves wallet.

Please take some time to understand some important things for your own safety.  
We cannot recover your funds or freeze your account if you visit a phishing site or lose your backup phrase \(aka SEED phrase\).  
By continuing to use our platform, you agree to accept all risks associated with the loss of your SEED, including but not limited to the inability to obtain your funds and dispose of them.  
In case you lose your SEED, you agree and acknowledge that the Waves Platform would not be responsible for the negative consequences of this.

To continue, click on the **What you need to know about your SEED**
**Note** We strongly recommend reading all articles before you begin.

Waves will display an important reminder. Never provide your backup phrase to anyone except the official Waves client. We recommend that you write the backup phrase on a piece of paper and store it in a secure location. Do not store the backup phrase unencrypted on any electronic device.

Carefully read the warning and only then click on **I understand**
