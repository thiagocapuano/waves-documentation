# Create a personal Alias

An Alias is a string between 4 and 30 characters long consisting of lowercase Latin letters, digits and symbols. It is possible to specify aliases instead of full address for asset transfers and leasing transactions. The cost is limited to 0.001 WAVES \(the Tx fee\).

The following characters are allowed in the alias name:

* lowercase Latin letters
* numbers
* dot
* underscore
* hyphen
* @

**Please remember, created alias cannot be changed and removed from the Waves address**.

The creation of an Alias is very straightforward;

Login to your Waves account.
