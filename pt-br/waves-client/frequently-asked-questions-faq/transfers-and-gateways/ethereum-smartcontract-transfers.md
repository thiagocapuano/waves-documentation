# Processing Ethereum payments and smart-contracts

Since recently there have been more Ethereum deposits to Waves made from third-party exchanges and other services using smart contracts resulting from "internal transactions" payments that our gateway can't yet process and deposit to Waves accounts.

Wavesplatform does not support deposits/withdrawals of Ethereum from/to smart contracts addresses, and we warn our users that they can lose their money if they do so. However, neither Waves nor our users can control third-party services that sometimes use smart contracts to perform the Ethereum withdraw operations.

**NOTE**: Before using the Ethereum gateway, please pay attention to the yellow box with warning and check the sender or recipient address.
