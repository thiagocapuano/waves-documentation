# I have placed an order. When it will be filled?

The order time depends only on the selected price. The higher/lower chosen price from the market price, the longer your order will not be filled.

If you put buy or sell order by market price, the transaction will be processed within a few seconds. So, you need to wait until the order will be filled or you can cancel and create a new one.

To cancel the opened order just click on the **X Cancel** in the **My Open Orders** box.
