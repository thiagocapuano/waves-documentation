## Introduction

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Bitcoin Cash on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Bitcoins Cash are sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Bitcoin Cash token \(wBCH\) issued in the Waves blockchain. Every single Bitcoin Cash token is backed 1:1 with the real Bitcoin Cash.

## How to use sponsored fee

So how to do it? Just create an outgoing transfer described above and click on the **WAVES** under **Transaction Fee**.
Choose an available sponsored token and click on the **Continue** button.
