## Introduction

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Bitcoin SV on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Bitcoins Cash are sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Bitcoin SV token \(wBSV\) issued in the Waves blockchain. Every single Bitcoin SV token is backed 1:1 with the real Bitcoin SV.

Choose an available sponsored token and click on the **Continue** button.
