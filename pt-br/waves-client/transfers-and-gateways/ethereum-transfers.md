## Introduction

Waves allow you to hold and transfer Ethereum on its blockchain. This works through a so-called Multigateway approach: Ethereum sent to a user's deposit address available in the Waves wallet and after the deposit the user receives a Ethereum token \(wETH\) issued in the Waves blockchain. Every single Ethereum token is backed 1:1 with the real Ethereum.

>Check if your wallet or exchange uses smart-contracts to withdraw ETH. We do not accept such transactions and canâ€™t refund them. You will lose that money.

**The minimum amount of deposit is 0.001 ETH**

>If you will send less than 0.001 ETH, you will lose that money.

## How to use sponsored fee

Waves users can also use a sponsored fee to pay for outgoing transfers. Check your **Portfolio**, if you see there a token with **%** icon. So it means you can change the default Waves fee to another sponsored token.

So how to do it? Just create an outgoing transfer described above and click on the **WAVES** under **Transaction Fee**.
Choose an available sponsored token and click on the **Continue** button.
