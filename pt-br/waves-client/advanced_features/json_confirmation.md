# ​How to create JSON confirmation

As you may know, Waves app contains advanced functionality. One of them is [Script transaction](/waves-client/advanced_features/script_transaction.md). With this feature, you can create a multi-signature wallet. So, several owners of one Waves account can manage the funds stored on the same balance. For easier management of script transactions, we integrated a special section called **JSON**.

**Note**:The fee for a transfer of a Smart Asset from a Smart Account would be 0.001+0.004+0.004=**0.009 Waves**.
Set Alias for an account without a script would cost **0.001 WAVES**, whereas for a Smart Account it would be 0.001+0.004=**0.005 WAVES**.

**Before you start, please keep in mind. We do not recommend you submit JSON unless you are an experienced user. Errors may lead to loss of funds**.

You can use either [**Online Client**](https://dex.wavesplatform.com), or standalone version for [**Windows**](https://wavesplatform.com/files/WavesClient-win.zip), [**Mac**](https://wavesplatform.com/files/WavesClient-mac.dmg) or [**Linux**](https://wavesplatform.com/files/WavesClient-linux.deb).

So, to start using all available features of the application, first you need to activate the advanced features.

Open online or desktop Waves app and click on the **Account avatar** at the top right corner. Then click on the **Settings**.

At the top right corner click on the **<> JSON** button.
