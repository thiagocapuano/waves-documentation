# What is the suspicious transaction in my wallet?

Wavesplatform is open source and decentralized platform. For this reason, any member of the Waves network can create a new token and distribute it to other participants. Someone doing it to attract attention to their token, someone doing it to draw attention to their LPOS pool. Most often there is nothing wrong with that. But at the same time, some tokens can contain phishing links or violate the following requirements and rules regarding the token creation which are mentioning while creating a token. For this reason, we decided to create a special section for this type of tokens and mark them as **Suspicious**. Suspicious tokens can be found only by its Asset ID on the Waves DEX.

All suspicious tokens are placing into the suspicious folder. Suspicious filtering integrated into all Waves apps, such as: [**Online Client**](https://dex.wavesplatform.com), or standalone version for [**Windows**](https://wavesplatform.com/WavesClient-win.zip), [**Mac**](https://wavesplatform.com/WavesClient-mac.dmg), [**Linux**](https://wavesplatform.com/WavesClient-linux.deb), [**iOS**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/waves-wallet/id1233158971) and [**Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wavesplatform.wallet)

Beginning with version Waves client **1.2.8** suspicious tab is hidden. Also, starting from the same version, transactions with suspicious tokens are hidden in the Transactions tab. To gain access to suspicious tokens, you need to disable suspicious filter in the wallet settings. For more information, please contact the Waves [support](https://support.wavesplatform.com/) team.
