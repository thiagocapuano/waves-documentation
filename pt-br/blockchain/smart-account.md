# Smart account

A **smart account** is an [account](/blockchain/account.md) that has an [account script](/ride/ride-script/account-script.md) attached to it.

An account script is attached to the account with a [set script transaction](/blockchain/transaction-type/set-script-transaction.md). Only one script can be attached to the account.
