# Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How I can list my tokens on Waves ?

By implementing a gateway.

### 2. Do we vote for new features with our community tokens?

No. If your node is mining, you vote while generating blocks. [_**Check this article**_](/waves-environment/waves-protocol/activation-protocol.md)_**.**_

### 3. How much WAVES do I need to have in order to start the mining process?

In order to activate mining, the node needs not less than 1000 WAVES \(for testnet we can always provide you with that, do not hesitate to contact us\).

### 4. we have 90% threshold on testnet or 80?

It's 90%.

### 5. How to make a trading pair to usd if I have erc20?

[_**Waves Gateway Framework**_](https://github.com/jansenmarc/WavesGatewayFramework).

### 6. Where can i get the link for last mainnet state?

[_**Last Maninet State.**_](http://blockchain.wavesnodes.com/)

### 7. What is the incentive to run my own full node instead of leasing my coins \(assume I have 1000\)?

More revenue if you have enough people leasing to you and payout is not 100%. Also you have more options doing airdrops and providing services on Waves Platform with your node. Running a node might be profitable later on but it's not at the moment. If it is it's only marginal.

### 8. If one creates a coin gateway , does one have to keep the gateway running in order for other people to trade that coin on the waves dex?

Yes.

### 9. Can I get send through the private key? Or open your wallet with a private key Because I see now I can only open my wallet by importing seed?

A gateway is the technical way to list a coin.

### 10. I want to automatically send my tokens to multiple wallets on the waves platform. Is there a program or bot?

Yes, there are airdrop tools, e.g., [_**WavesLPoSDistributer**_](https://github.com/jansenmarc/WavesLPoSDistributer)_**.**_

### 11. What is the size of data that can be stored as Data TranSactions in Waves? And what is the type of data that can be stored?

Please check [_**Data transaction**_](/blockchain/transaction-type/data-transaction.md) article.
