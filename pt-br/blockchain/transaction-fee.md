# Transaction fee

A **transaction fee** is a fee that an [account](/blockchain/account.md) owner pays to send a [transaction](/blockchain/transaction.md).

A sender can specify any amount of fee but not less than a certain amount. The larger the fee is, the quicker the transaction will be added to the new [block](/blockchain/block.md).

> If a [smart account](/blockchain/smart-account.md) transfers a [smart asset](/blockchain/smart-asset.md), then the fee doubles. <br>If a transaction is validated by an [account script](/ride/ride-script/account-script.md) or an [asset script](/ride/ride-script/asset-script.md), then the fee is increased by 0.004 WAVES
