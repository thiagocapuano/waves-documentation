# Non-fungible token

A **non-fungible token** or **NFT** is a special type of a [token](/blockchain/token.md), that represents some _unique_ object.

Two regular tokens cannot be distinguished from each other â€” they are alike, i.e. _fungible_. Each NFT token is unique, and therefore NFTs are _non-fungible_. Any two NFTs can always be distinguished.

Every NFT has a unique ID.

NFTs are most commonly used in games.
