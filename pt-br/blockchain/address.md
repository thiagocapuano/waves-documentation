# Address

An **address** is a unique identifier of an [account](/blockchain/account.md).

The address allows a user to view account balance. [Tokens](/blockchain/token.md) can be sent to the address.

An address can be represented as an alphanumeric string or a scanned QR code.

Each account has a _single_ address.

One address can have several [aliases](/blockchain/alias.md).
