In this tutorial, we will go through the advanced features of the Waves Client, which are:

1. Getting the JSON of the transaction.
2. Attaching a script to the account.

Also, we will create a script for 2-of-2 mulitsignature account. Then we will attach the script to our account via Waves Client. After that, we will make a transfer transaction with two signatures.
