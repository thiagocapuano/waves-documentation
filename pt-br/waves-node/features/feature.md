# Feature

A **feature** is a new functionality added to the [Waves blockchain](/blockchain/blockchain.md) during a new [release](https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/releases).

Each feature has a name and a unique feature ID.

## Feature status

Each feature can be in one of three statuses:

1. Voting
2. Approved
3. Activated

Features are getting different statuses according to the [feature activation protocol](/waves-node/features/feature-activation-protocol.md).
