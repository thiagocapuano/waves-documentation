# Private Waves blockchain network setup

## Step 1

Install git, [Java 8](https://java.com/en/download/) and [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).

## Step 2

Clone [Waves repository](https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/).

## Step 3

Edit the `node/src/test/resources/genesis.example.conf` file with genesis block parameters, for example like this:

```
genesis-generator
{
  network-type: "L"  #your custom network identifier byte
  initial-balance: 10000000000000000  #initial balance in wavelets
  base-target: 153722867  #the initial complexity parameter
  average-block-delay: 60s #average block delay
  timestamp: 1500635421931 #comment this to use the current time

  # the sum of shares should be = initial-balance
  distributions
  {
    foo0 { # name for this account. Will be printed in generator's output
      seed-text: "foo0"
      nonce: 0
      amount: 10000000000000000
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 4

Run the genesis block generator command:

```sbt "node/runMain com.wavesplatform.GenesisBlockGenerator node/src/test/resources/genesis.example.conf genesis.conf"```

The result will be written to the `genesis.conf` file (instead of `genesis.conf`, you can use arbitrary name), and it will look like this:

```
Addresses:
foo0:
 Seed text:           foo0
 Seed:                3csAfH
 Account seed:        58zgAnBg775J6NKd4qVtfeX3m5TBMeizHNY9STvm2N87
 Private account key: FYLXp1ecxQ6WCPD4axTotHU9RVfPCBLfSeKx1XSCyvdT
 Public account key:  GbGEY3XVc2ohdv6hQBukVKSTQyqP8rjQ8Kigkj6bL57S
 Account address:     3JfE6tjeT7PnpuDQKxiVNLn4TJUFhuMaaT5
Settings:
genesis {
  average-block-delay: 60000ms
  initial-base-target: 153722867
  timestamp: 1500635421931
  block-timestamp: 1500635421931
  signature: "3NELFXiQqQoYUfgLba5YAS1z8gJLc19zfzSvmYRX9eLso4zGByRGDpWdL4cooHTocyi5boFiu6H7hyW3ukVGtswP"
  initial-balance: 10000000000000000
  transactions = [
    {recipient: "3JfE6tjeT7PnpuDQKxiVNLn4TJUFhuMaaT5", amount: 10000000000000000}
  ]
}
```

If you built a fat JAR, you can generate a genesis block through it. For example:

```
java -cp ./node/target/waves-all-0.17.2-grpc-27-g0fab715-DIRTY.jar com.wavesplatform.GenesisBlockGenerator node/src/test/resources/genesis.example.conf
```

The output will be the same.

## Step 5

Open a text editor and create `waves-custom-network.conf` (or any other name) file.

You can enable following features on your node by modifying the `pre-activated-features` parameter in the file.

| Features | Name | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Minimum Generating Balance of 1000 WAVES | ACTIVATED |
| 2 | NG Protocol | ACTIVATED |
| 3 | Mass Transfer Transaction | ACTIVATED |
| 4 | Smart Accounts | ACTIVATED |
| 5 | Data Transaction | ACTIVATED |
| 6 | Burn Any Tokens | ACTIVATED |
| 7 | Fee Sponsorship | ACTIVATED |
| 8 | Fair PoS | ACTIVATED |
| 9 | Smart Assets | ACTIVATED |
| 10 | Smart Account Trading | ACTIVATED |

> If the directory parameter was not redefined, the waves folder will be created in 
<br>Linux: $XDG_DATA_HOME/waves or $HOME/.local/share/waves
<br>Win: %APPDATA%/local/waves
<br>Mac OS: $HOME/Library/Application Support/waves

> The `address-scheme-character` parameter value from below must be the same as the `network-type` value from the step 3.

> The contents of the `genesis` section from below is what was generated on the step 4. Instead of pasting this section, you can just write `include "genesis.conf"`, where the `genesis.conf` is a filename from the step 4.

    # enables "off-line generation".
    quorum = 0
  }
}
```

Pay attention to the parameters `waves.blockchain.custom.address-scheme-character` and `waves.blockchain.custom.genesis`. They were copied from the result and settings of genesis generator tool. Also, look at `waves.wallet.seed` value. This value can be copied from "Seed" value for one of the genesis addresses from the result of genesis generator tool.

## Step 6

Start your custom network node by running:

```sbt "run waves-custom-network.conf"```

Also, you can run already built release package (deb or jar) with this configuration file manually.

Done! You created your private Waves network consisting of one node!

## Adding Nodes to Your Network

You can add more nodes to your network using `waves.network.known-peers` parameter, specify the address and port of the existing node with the same network parameters like "127.0.0.1:6860". If you are making several nodes locally, then do not forget to change for the new nodes the network port `waves.network.port`, the API port `waves.rest-api.port`, folder for the data `waves.directory` and wallet seed `waves.wallet.seed`.

`waves.blockchain.custom.functionality` section contains parameters that allow you to enable and disable some features in your blockchain system.

**Note**. The developers can add new parameters in `waves.blockchain.custom.functionality` section, which are not present in this example; for an example of a working configuration, you can look at the [waves-devnet.conf file in root folder of repository](https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/blob/master/node/waves-devnet.conf).

Check our [configuration file documentation](/waves-node/configuration-parameters.md) for more information.
