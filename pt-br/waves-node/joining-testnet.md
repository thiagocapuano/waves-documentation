# Waves Testnet

Testnet is a fully functioning Waves blockchain with the one key exception that because the Waves on the network can be created freely, it has no value. Testnet helps developers test new versions of Waves, as well as test network operations using identical versions of the software before they are carried out on the mainnet.
