# What is Waves Platform

_**Waves Platform is a comprehensive blockchain platform that features **_[_**fiat gateways**_](/waves-client/wallet-management.md)_**, **_[_**smart contracts**_](/smart-contracts/waves-contracts-language-description.md)_**, **_[_**mobile wallet**_](/waves-client/mobile-apps.md)_**, **_[_**token issuance**_](/waves-client/assets-management.md)_**, a **_[_**DEX \(decentralized exchange\)**_](/waves-client/waves-dex.md)_**, and more.**_

## Main Waves Features

* [_**Fully functional exchange**_](/waves-environment/waves-protocol/decentralized-cryptocurrency-exchange-dex.md) that is as fast as a centralized one but does not suffer from the same security issues.
* [_**Smart contracts**_](/smart-contracts/waves-contracts-language-description.md) include account and token controls, which provide functionality to implement features such as multi-signature wallets, atomic swaps and 2-factor authorization.
* It provides the services of launching, distributing and trading crypto token \(creation, issuance, transfer, exchange of assets and custom or fiat tokens\).
* The fiat-crypto problem is solved through [_**Waves fiat gateways**_](/waves-client/wallet-management.md).
* [_**Waves-NG protocol**_](/waves-environment/waves-protocol/waves-ng-protocol.md) which greatly increases TPS capacity because miners no longer compete to verify transactions.
* [_**Leased Proof-of-Stake\(LPoS\)**_](/waves-environment/waves-protocol/leased-proof-of-stake-lpos.md) algorithm to find a distributed consensus.
